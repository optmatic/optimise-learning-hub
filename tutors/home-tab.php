                    <h3>Welcome to the Tutor Dashboard!</h3>
                    <p>This platform is the designated area for writing and submitting lesson overviews based on your students' tutoring lessons.</p>
                    <p>It is of utmost importance that you log in and promptly complete the overviews following each student's lesson, as parents eagerly anticipate reading about their child's progress within 24 hours of the lesson's conclusion.</p>
                    <p>As you write your overviews, please bear in mind that parents will be reviewing them closely. Therefore, it is crucial to adhere to the following guidelines:</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>Ensure accurate spelling of the student's name.</li>
                      <li>Observe appropriate capitalisation rules, including using a capital letter at the beginning of the student's name.</li>
                      <li>Maintain a consistently positive tone, refraining from any negative comments about the student.</li>
                      <li>Alternate between using the child's name and pronouns (she/he) as the first word in each sentence, as exemplified below:</li>
                    </ul>
                    <blockquote>
                      <p style="background-color: rgba(42, 98, 143, 0.07); padding: 10px; font-style: italic;">"Jane focused very well this afternoon. She demonstrated a solid understanding of the distinction between prime and composite numbers. Jane diligently completed several exercises to reinforce and expand her knowledge of factors. She would benefit from additional practice to further develop her understanding of factors."</p>
                    </blockquote>
                    <ul>
                        <li>When writing the lesson focus, please check the student's Learning Plan and reference their learning goals.</li>
                        <li>Ensure that your writing is appropriately punctuated to enhance clarity and coherence.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>You can refer to the sample lesson overview tab or the lists of sample comments tab to assist you with your lesson overviews. Please do not hesitate to contact Tracey or Roxanne if you have any concerns or questions regarding your overviews.</p>
                    <p>Thank you for your commitment to writing personalised and positive lesson overviews that enable parents to read about how their child is progressing towards their learning goals.</p>
